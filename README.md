# JS13K Games 2017

My game entry for JS13K Games 2017 on the theme "Lost".

# Goal

Tourist: noun, /'toorəst/. Person geographically and culturally lost, trying to cross iconic monuments off their bucket list before their tour bus departs.

You have 2 minutes to locate as many monuments as possible in Paris. (Given the game is unfinished, the tourist is the small blinking square, whereas the monuments are the big blinking squares, red if unvisited, green if visited).

# Controls

Move: arrow keys / WASD (Englih keybard) / ZQSD (French keyboard) / tap or swipe screen (think of screen as a D-Pad)

Desktop and mobile.

# Getting Started

```
npm start
-> build game, open a browser, watch source and livereload browser on changes

npm run build
-> build game for gamejam submission (no sourcemap and livereload script)
```
